## 1 - Install Notes

Ensure android-studio is running first?

```
npm install -g expo
expo init MyProject
cd MyProject
npm install
expo start
```

After `expo start` runs, a local window pops up,
change the connection to tunneling

Press "Run on android simulator" with only the phone connected (no virtual devices)
